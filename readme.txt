I want to use my late penalty waver

For the implementation of perlin noise bump map I added one import (added in the requirements.txt)

All the renders of the base test scenes are in the folder ./out

-=-=-= PART 10 =-=-=-=-
Novel Scene is: Everything.png, I was trying to show of every feature in one scene

-=-=-= PART 11 =-=-=-=-
Additial scenes and renders are in the "additional scenes and render" folder
Additional features:
- (0.5) Mirror refection: Mirror.png, a floor made of a mirrior material
- (0.5) Refraction: Refract.png, a glass ball that refracts the light
- (1pt) Depth of feild: DOF.png, the same scene as TwoSpheresPlane but with DOF
- (0.5) Quadrics: Quad.png, a quadric render
- (1pt) Perlin noise bump map: Bump.png, bump map'ed sphere
- (2pt) Hierarching bounding volumes: comment out line 22 of main.py and run TorusMesh.json to see the difference in render time

Total should be 5.5 points on part 11. (4pt + 1.5 bonus)
